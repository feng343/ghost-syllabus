# ghost-syllabus

This project is not a traditional course recommendation tool, but rather an experiment that intervenes in the linguistic structures of educational systems. I observed that many art course descriptions are abstract, complex, and even exclusionary, making it difficult for students to understand the true content and intentions of the courses.  
这个项目不是一个传统意义上的课程推荐工具，而是一种介入教育系统语言结构的实验。我观察到，许多艺术课程的介绍语言抽象、复杂、甚至带有排他性，使得学生难以理解课程真正的内容与意图。

**ghost-syllabus** attempts to translate this kind of “institutional abstract language” into expressions that are more accessible and relatable to students’ lived experiences. It is not just a tool—it is a reflection: has art education been alienated by the very language it uses?  
ghost-syllabus尝试将这种“制度性抽象语言”转译为更易理解、贴近学生经验的语言表达。它不仅是一种工具，更是一种反思：艺术教育是否被语言本身所异化？

I designed a webpage that, on the surface, appears to be a course recommendation assistant. In reality, it functions as a language translation device to “decode” obscure course descriptions. On the other side of the interface is an anonymous chatroom—a hidden echo chamber—where students can share their real experiences with these courses without revealing their identities. Together, these two components create an experimental space for the democratization of educational language.  
我设计了一个网页，它表面看似是一个课程推荐助手，实际却是一种语言翻译装置，用来“解码”那些晦涩的课程描述；与此同时，页面的另一侧是匿名聊天室，一个隐秘的回声室，让学生在不暴露身份的前提下，交流他们对这些语言的真实感受与经验。两个部分共同构成一个“语言民主化”的实验空间。

This project is concerned with:  
本项目关注：

- How language shapes our access to and understanding of knowledge  
  语言如何影响我们对知识的接近与理解  
- How students navigate systemic obscurity in search of their own paths  
  学生如何在系统性晦涩中寻找属于自己的路径  
- How technology can intervene in the translation of institutional language  
  技术在“翻译制度语言”中的介入可能

This is a co-creative language tool for future students, and an ongoing critical proposal on the power structures embedded in educational language—we invite you to join this translation movement.  
这是一个面向未来学生的语言共创工具，也是一份正在进行中的、关于教育语言权力的批评性提案——我们邀请你一同加入这场翻译行动。

## Why “ghost-syllabus”?  
## 为什么是“ghost-syllabus”？

Because some course descriptions are like ghosts:  
因为有些课程语言就像幽灵：

- Visible, but unreadable;  
  看得见，读不懂；  
- Present, but lacking lived experience;  
  存在着，却没有经验感；  
- Written, but never spoken.  
  被写下，却不被说出。

ghost-syllabus attempts to summon these “ghosts” into presence, translating them into language that can be understood, chosen, and responded to.  
ghost-syllabus 试图召唤这些“幽灵”现形，并把它们翻译成人可以理解、可以选择、可以回应的语言。
